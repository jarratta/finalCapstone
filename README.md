The inventory.txt file should be located within the same directory as the inventory.py file.  The inventory.py file can then be run from your preferred IDE.  The math and tabulate functions are required.

***## Usage***
The application is a Python coding demonstration to show:
* Use of classes to maange data
* Use of class methods to show data
* Use of functions to create application functionality
* Read of data from a text file
* Writing of data to a text file
* Use of "try" and "expect" functions to manage data quality
* Use of the tabulate package to provide user friendly reports
